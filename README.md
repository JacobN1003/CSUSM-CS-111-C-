# CSUSM-CS-111-Cplusplus
These projects were made using C++ to help me learn the C++ programming language. The lab instructions were used from 
what I have been taught in the introductory course, Computer Science 111 at California State University San Marcos, using C++. 
These programs are beginner level and only completed using the format of the lab instruction.
